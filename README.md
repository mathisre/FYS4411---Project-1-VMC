# FYS4411---Project-1-VMC
Inside src lies the program used for the vmc algorithms. Parameters like number of particles, dimensions, alpha, beta etc are set in main.cpp. If you wish to study non-interacting bosons, make sure that interactionSize = 0. Alter beta to change from a spherical to an elliptical ho potential. For our studies we have used beta = 2.82843. The program can be compiled using ./compile.sh and then run using ./prog.x. By default there are no command line arguments, but this is easily changed.

The program blocking.py runs taking the textfile as command line argument.

# FYS4411---Project-1-VMC
Inside src lies the program used to perform the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithms on a system of bosons in a spherical or elliptical harmonic potential. 
Parameters such as number of particles, number of dimensions, number of Monte carlo steps, variational parameter alpha, parameter beta to control the shape of potential, frequency of harmonic potential, etc. are set in main.cpp. If you wish to study non-interacting bosons, make sure that interactionSize = 0 and beta=1. Alter beta to change from a spherical to an elliptical HO potential. For our studies we have used beta = 2.82843 which is equal to omega_z and interactionSize=0.0043. It is also possible to perform a numerical derivatives instead of an analytical one just comment and un-comment the appropriate lines in Hamiltonians->HarmonicOscillator::computeLocalEnergy.

The program can be compiled using ./compile.sh and then run using ./prog.x. 
By default there are no command line arguments, but this is can be easily changed.

Moreover, inside src (folder "blocking") there is a python code to perform the blocking method to compute the statistical error on a dataset which takes into account the correlations between data. It requires as input that dataset in the function loadtxt().

In folder "Figures", there are all the plots made for the report.

In folder "Data", there are some results which we find important i.e. the ground state energy computed with the optimal parameters alpha found through gradient descent for 10,50,100 particles in 3D and examples about the computation of the one-body densities.

The program blocking.py runs taking the textfile as command line argument.
